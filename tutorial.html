            <p>Duskr is a <em>user-friendly</em> software (only two buttons!) that enables your timelapse sequence to use the depth of raw, instead of beeing stuck to jpeg. It is specially comfortable to work with raws when the light condistions are changing.<br><strong>You can develop only the first and the last image, Duskr will interpolate the rest! </strong></p>
            <p>It works alongside Adobe CameraRaw (that comes with Photoshop), so you will continue to develop your photographs with the software you are familliar with.</p>
