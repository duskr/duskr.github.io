            <h4>What?</h4>
            <p>Duskr is a <em>user-friendly</em> software (only two buttons!) that enables your timelapse sequence to use the depth of raw, instead of beeing stuck to jpeg. It is specially comfortable to work with raws when the light condistions are changing.<br><strong>You can develop only the first and the last image, Duskr will interpolate the rest! </strong></p>
            <p>It works alongside Adobe CameraRaw (that comes with Photoshop), so you will continue to develop your photographs with the software you are familliar with.</p>

    <!-- WHY -->
    <div class="row">

        <div class="col-lg-6">
            <h4>Why?</h4>
            <p>So far, it was very complicated to capture a timelapse of a sunset or in any other conditions where the light is not constant. For doing so, you usually have to buy a <em>bulb-ramping</em> device which is expensive and not easy to use. Then you would most of the time batch-process hundreds of images with the same settings, and thats a shame!</p>
            <p>During a timelapse, conditions are evolving, clouds are passing, sun is setting, storm is comming, etc. <strong>So why would you batch process all the pictures the same way?</Strong><br>Each of them deserve to show the best of the moment.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-lg-6">
            <h4>How?</h4>
            <p>Let's say you already captured your sequence in raw with your favorite camera and you got 500 photos! Great!
            <br>If the conditions just went darker or lighter, without any other variation, it's then even easier : develop the first and the last image of your sequence with CameraRaw (which is automatically opened when you try to open a raw with Photoshop). Just do it normaly to make both look the best they can and when you save, you will have two new <strong>xmp</strong> files near your images.
            <br>Launch Duskr, select one of your raw, launch the interpolation.</p>
            <p>At the end of the process, you will be able to open all the sequence with Photoshop CameraRaw, select all, export all, you're done!</p>
